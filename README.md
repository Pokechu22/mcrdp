# mcrdp

An experimental Minecraft mod that displays a single RDP connection while in-game.

And by "experimental", I mean **experimental** - this is very unstable.  It's more a toy project than anything else, but it's interesting.

Powered by [properjavardp](http://properjavardp.sourceforge.net/) (specifically, [a tweaked version](https://github.com/Pokechu22/properjavardp)).  Most of the graphical artifacts are from it; still trying to figure those out.

## Usage

A sign containing the text `mcrdp` on the first line will activate a display.  The second line can contain the width and height in blocks, such as `1x1` (if not specified, `8x6` is assumed).
